    <h1>Marché noir</h1>
    <p>
      Marché Noir is a global creative collective uniting visionary artists, designers, and innovators across the entire creative spectrum. Born in the vibrant hubs of New York City and Stockholm, we are not an agency—we are a dynamic network of creatives collaborating across borders to tackle diverse briefs and deliver extraordinary outcomes. From video and animation to tech, design, and branding, our collective thrives on the belief that creativity knows no boundaries, and by connecting passionate minds worldwide, we craft solutions that are as unique as the challenges we face.
      At Marché Noir, we bring together diverse talents—filmmakers, animators, UI/UX designers, brand strategists, developers, and storytellers—to create work that resonates. Our decentralized approach allows us to tap into a global pool of expertise, ensuring every project is met with fresh perspectives and cutting-edge ideas. Whether it’s a captivating motion graphic, an immersive digital interface, a transformative brand identity, or a groundbreaking tech solution, we’re here to make it happen, together.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      We exist to redefine how creative work is done. Marché Noir is a movement that empowers independent creatives to collaborate without constraints, blending artistry with innovation to solve real-world problems. Our mission is to build a borderless network where ideas flow freely, spanning video, animation, design, tech, and beyond, and every brief is an opportunity to push the limits of what’s possible. We’re not just creating for today—we’re shaping the future of creativity.
    </p>
    <h3>How We Work</h3>
